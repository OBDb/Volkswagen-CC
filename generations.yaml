    description: "The Volkswagen CC, initially sold as the Passat CC, is a premium four-door coupé derivative of the Passat sedan, featuring more stylish, swooping bodywork with frameless doors and a lower, sleeker roofline. Built on the same PQ46 platform as the contemporary Passat B6, the CC shared much of its mechanical architecture while offering a distinctly more upscale appearance and positioning. The elegant exterior featured a dramatically sloping roofline, a more aggressive front end, and clean surfacing that helped the model achieve a drag coefficient of just 0.29. Initially configured as a strict four-seater with individual rear bucket seats, later models adopted a more practical three-person rear bench. Engine options varied by market but typically included a range of turbocharged four-cylinder petrol and diesel units plus a 3.6-liter VR6 in higher-end variants, with power outputs ranging from approximately 140 to 300 horsepower. Transmission choices included six-speed manual and six or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic options, with front-wheel drive standard and 4MOTION all-wheel drive available on select higher-powered models. The interior featured a driver-oriented cockpit with higher quality materials than the standard Passat, available features including adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic parking assistance."

    description: "A facelift to the CC was presented at the LA Auto Show, and production started in January 2012. The front and rear were revised to make the CC look similar to the then current Volkswagen design, while the midsection was unchanged. Interior changes included minor updates to the center console along with an updated A/C control panel. New features included improved Adaptive Chassis Control (DCC), Bi-Xenon headlights with Advanced Front-Lighting System (AFS) curve lights and Dynamic Light Assist glare-free high beams, fatigue detection system, Front Assist with 'city emergency braking' system, Side Assist Plus, Lane Assist, Rear Assist, Park Assist, Traffic sign recognition, and Easy Open. The XDS electronic differential brake that was also used in the Golf GTI was available on the CC as standard or optional equipment. The name was officially changed from 'Passat CC' to simply 'CC' with this facelift. Model years continued through 2017, though production ended in 2016."
