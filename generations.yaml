    description: "The Volkswagen CC (originally launched as the Passat CC before being renamed simply 'CC' in 2012) was introduced as a premium four-door coupé derivative of the Passat sedan, featuring more stylish, swooping bodywork with frameless doors and a lower, sleeker roofline. Built on the same PQ46 platform as the contemporary Passat B6/B7, the CC shared much of its mechanical architecture while offering a distinctly more upscale appearance and positioning. The elegant exterior featured a dramatically sloping roofline, a more aggressive front end, and clean surfacing that helped the model achieve a drag coefficient of just 0.29, while the overall effect created a vehicle that appeared more expensive than its actual price point. Initially configured as a strict four-seater with individual rear bucket seats, later models adopted a more practical three-person rear bench. Engine options varied by market but typically included a range of turbocharged four-cylinder petrol and diesel units plus a 3.6-liter VR6 in higher-end variants, with power outputs ranging from approximately 140 to 300 horsepower. Transmission choices included six-speed manual and six or seven-speed dual-clutch automatic options, with front-wheel drive standard and 4MOTION all-wheel drive available on select higher-powered models. The interior featured a driver-oriented cockpit with higher quality materials than the standard Passat, available features including adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic parking assistance—advanced technology for its segment at the time. A significant facelift in 2012 coincided with the name change to simply 'CC,' bringing revised styling with new headlights, grille, and bumpers more closely aligned with Volkswagen's contemporary design language. The CC successfully carved out a niche for itself by offering near-premium styling and features at mainstream pricing, appealing to buyers seeking a more distinctive, style-focused alternative to conventional sedans, though at the cost of some practicality due to its lower roofline and associated reduction in rear headroom."
